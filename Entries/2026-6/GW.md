## Entry 001 — Kimsuky HTTPSpy

**Ref:** [Global-Watch June 2026]
**Date:** 2026-06-05

### Strategic Implication

Kimsuky's approach here is notable because they're not bringing their own infrastructure — they're hijacking trusted platforms. VS Code tunnels, Cloudflare Quick Tunnels, and Webex aren't suspicious by default, which means traditional detection based on known-bad indicators largely fails. The encrypted tunnel layer makes traffic analysis harder on top of that. The GPKI certificate theft is the most serious piece though — with legitimate South Korean government certificates, Kimsuky can impersonate official entities inside government networks with no immediate red flags. That's not just access, that's trusted access, which is a fundamentally different threat level.

### India Relevance

India operates similar GPKI-equivalent infrastructure — certificate-based authentication is standard across government systems. If Kimsuky can compromise South Korea's government PKI, the same methodology applies to Indian systems. More broadly, India's neutrality with both Koreas creates the same soft target problem as with Russia-Ukraine — neither side treats action against Indian interests as a serious escalation risk. North Korea targeting Indian government infrastructure to create pressure or force a diplomatic position isn't far-fetched. It's a low-cost move with potential high leverage.

### Pattern Tracking

*To be completed — pending review of Global-Watch log.*
